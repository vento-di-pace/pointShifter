description= Shifts points for specified distance from nearest line segment according side attribute from point layer
version=1.3
author=Eugene Nazarenko
email=eugene.v.nazarenko@gmail.com
about=Tool is used for define attribute information about position of input point and to fix this position according input line side attribute. 
      It finds nearest link from Streets layer.Then find coordinates of point that is the end of perpendicular line from point to found street 
      link and lies on the link. After it one calculates percent of length from reference node to this point on link and find coordinates of point, 
      which lies on perpendicular from correct side (defined in input attribute "side") on defined in input parameter distance from street link.

changelog=Latest version of plugin is 1.3
         pointShifter v1.3
         *fixed evaluation of situations then point falls on start(end) of line segment or falls outside line segment
         *improve search nearest line algorithm
         *add log file which names as a result shape file just with *.log extention


         pointShifter v1.2
         *fixed evaluation of situations then point falls on start(end) of line segment or falls outside line segment
         *pfrn sets to1 if it less that 1 and to 99 if it more that 99


         pointShifter v1.1
         +added threshold maximum distance for search between point and lines
         *fixed reference node (southmost and westernmost node of the line) detection and PFRN calculation
         *fixed cancellation of process data
         
         pointShifter v 1.0
         as known as Vhizk for now ))
         *changed icon
         +added ability to shift points to real current side with check box, which allow to switch these modes
         +added additional field REF_IN_ID, which fills from linear layer if it exists there.
         +added NEW_SIDE field, which is filled with real calculated with plugin side
         *fixed side and shifting calculations
         *fixed reference node detection algorithm

         pointShifter v0.6b
         improve search of neighbour link to point - get 5 links and calculate min distance link from them.
         set default point moving distance to 0.000045 degree (5 meters)
         fix destructor of QgsVectorFileWriter position and wrap it into try..finally block.
         pointShifter v0.5b
         work version with debug=ON
         changes:
         fixed adding of the new featire to output shapefile
         point on line calculated within script instead of data from closestSegmentInContext
         icon changed
         fixed lineTextEdit config
